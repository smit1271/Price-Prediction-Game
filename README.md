# Price Prediction Game

The Price Prediction Game is a decentralized game where users can place bets on the direction of a specific price (e.g., BTC/USD) within a given time slot. The game utilizes smart contracts on an EVM-compatible chain, retrieves price data from Chainlink, and allows users to interact with the game through a ReactJS frontend. 
## Features

- Users can connect their wallets and view their game token balance.
- Real-time price feed from Chainlink is displayed to users.
- Users can place bets on the price going up or down.
- Game rounds are initiated by the manager/owner account.
- Slot finalization distributes rewards to the winners.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: Programming language for smart contract development.
- ReactJS: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- Chainlink: Decentralized oracle network for retrieving price data.
- Web3.js: Library for interacting with smart contracts from the frontend.
